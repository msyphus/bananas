# Bananas For Statistics

### Demo
A demo of this app is available [here.](https://msyphus.shinyapps.io/bananas/)

### General
I have posted a series of [tutorial videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH_m2iGW5-wQ1YDMmugVcdet7rD8xbVWJ) on YouTube that explain real world application of statistics and design of experiments in a business setting.  The tutorials are on an introductory level, specifically geared towards Lean Six Sigma Green Belts.  To go along with these videos, I created an R Shiny Dashboard that shows results of the example tests performed in the videos and explains how to interpret the results.  This repository is also shared so those interested in learning how to perform the tests in R can see how it's done.

The videos, dashboard app, and this repo are all instructional in nature so there are a lot of comments and omissions of details (such as assumptions testing) in order to keep it on a basic level for beginners.

The dashboard app has two tabs.  The Dashboard tab shows a quick conclusion of the example scenario from the tutorial series.  The Details tab gives the printouts of each test, visualizations of the models, and an explanation of how to interpret them all.
